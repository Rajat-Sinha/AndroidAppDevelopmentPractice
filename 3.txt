//Android
 //To Link Java with xml
  For linking any widget with java we need to give reference by id for this a method finViewById() method id used
  To Linking Text in xml with java we need to import it's property
  import android.widget.TextView;
  Then we have to give refernce in java 
  TextView text_name = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.idname_which_is_given_to_text_in_xml);
  Also for using others widget from xml to java we have to also import ther property too.
  import android.widget.Button;
  import android.widget.EditText;
  Then we have to give refernce in java
  Button button_name = (Button) findViewById(R.id.idname_which_is_given_to_button_in_xml);
  EditText edit  = (EditText) findViewByid(R.id.idname_which_is_given_to_edittext_in_xml);
//OnClick()
  Suppose if we want to run some code after clicking a button then for this we have to use setOnClickListener() method
  button_name.setOnClickListener(
    new Button.OnClickListener(){
      //here we have to use override method
      public void onClick(View view){
        //code which we want to run after clicking the button
      }
    }
  );
  To use onClick function we need import something to use it
  import android.view.View
  
//onLongClick()
  Suppose if we want to run some code after clicking long a button then for this we have to use setOnLongClickListener() method
  button_name.setOnLongClickListener(
    new Button.OnLongClickListener(){
      //here we have override it's method
      public boolean onLongClick(){
         //code which we want to run after clicking the button for long
         return true;
      }
    }
  );
  
//to set the text of xml from java
  for setting the text in xml from java we have to use setText() method
  text_name.setText("Text which we want");
//for geeting text from the input
  Supoose if user write something in the input Box then we have to grabb it for this we have to use getText() and then we have to convert it into String
  String edit = edit.getText().toString();
  
//Java
  //toString()
      it is used to convert any thing into string
